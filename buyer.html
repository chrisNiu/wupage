          <h2>Buyers</h2>
          <p><strong>Let me help you every step of the way.</strong></p>
          <p>Even if you start your search online, when searching for your dream home it is important to be well informed of the Real Estate market. We have had success in matching our clients with the perfect property for them. As your Buyerâ€™s Agent, we can provide local knowledge, market expertise, enthusiasm, representation, and strategic negotiating to purchase your dream home in the shortest period of time.</p>

          <p><strong>Your First Step</strong></p>
          <p>Your first step to buying a home is to first ask yourself why you want to buy a home: to stop paying rent? To start building equity? To have a place of your own? To raise a family? To entertain business associates? To move up to a bigger house? Next, list what kind of home you'd like and where you would like to be. Be specific. Separate the "must haves" from the "want to haves."</p>
          <p>Think of yourself as zeroing in on a target, going from the general to the specific. Consider area (city, suburban neighborhood, country); community (north, south, east, or west side); neighborhood (older and settled or sparkling new; a particular school zone; recreational facilities; and other community services such as transportation, day care, library, stores, entertainment). Ask yourself how many minutes you are willing to commute to work.</p>
          <p>Think about home styles. How much space do you need? Does your situation require a one-level home, or are stairs acceptable? Consider size and kind of property. Do you want a newer home, or maybe an older one to fix up? Someday you or your heirs will want to sell. Consider how long you expect to live in this particular home.</p>

          <p><strong>You Next Step: Loan Pre-Qualification</strong></p>
          <p>Once you have addressed the above needs, your next step in the purchasing process is to get pre-qualified with a mortgage company. This can be done over the phone or even online in a matter of minutes.</p>
          <p>Call me and I will refer you to a mortgage professional that has an excellent reputation and track record for successfully acquiring loan approval for his/her clients.</p>
          <p><strong>I will Find the Right Homes For you</strong></p>
          <p>Once you've been pre-qualified and know what price range you want to stay in, I can help you determine which properties fit your needs by using the (MLS) Multiple Listing Service system to locate them.</p>
          <p>I have the best possible resources and communication systems available today to help you locate the homes on the market that match your specifications. You can even search my listings here at my website.</p>
          <p><strong>I Will Help You Every Step Of The Way</strong></p>
          <p>I will help you complete your financing and inspections, and close on the transaction. My top priority is to make sure that your home buying experience is pleasant, cost-efficient, and successful. </p>
